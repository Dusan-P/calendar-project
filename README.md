# calendar-project
## A calendar app that generates a full year calendar
The user is prompted to select a starting date
Based on that starting date, a calendar that goes up to that date of the next year is generated
There is also a period table, on which the user can mark which periods in a day are active
Based on the users input of active period, the app will calculate how many active periods the user has in that year, by months
